This is a web application that allows users to search for housing options around USC. If you are a logged in user, you can write reviews for housing options, add options to your Top-Housing page, and add "roommates" to your roommates list. It also uses the Google Maps API to display all the options on a map and allows the user to filter what shows up on the map using many available filter options. This was written using Java Servlets, JSP/HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and the MySQL Workbench.
